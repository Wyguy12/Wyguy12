Hello! 

My name is Wyatt

A little about my background...

I graduated college in 2014 through Central Lakes College with a 2 year robotics/automated systems technology A.A.S Degree. I then moved into a robotics/automation technician position where I have gained extensive knowledge in automation programming, mechanical/electrical, assembly/wiring as well as troubleshooting skills. 

In my most recent position I worked in an electrical designer role where I designed electrical schematics/2D panel layouts for control and power distribution enclosures for various applications such as reverse osmosis, gravity & horizontal pressure filter systems among many others in the water treatment industry.

I am currently enrolled as a Computer Science student at the University of Concordia - St. Paul since September 2023, I am actively seeking an entry-level developer position. With a strong foundation in front-end as well as back-end development, I look forward to using my technical problem-solving skills and passion for technology to contribute to writing clean effective and efficient code as well as maintaining active projects.
